\title{Bi-Directional x and y axis Rescaling}
\usage{
rescale_x_2(v)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A vector of values}
}
\value{
A list of three vectors (x, y, z).  x is a vector of values from 0 to 1 equal in length to the input vector v. y is a scaled (from 0 to 1) vector of the input values equal in lenght to the input vector v. z is a scaled (from -1 to +1) vector of the input values equal in length to the input vector v.
}
\description{
Rescales input values to two scales (0 to 1 and  -1 to 1) on the y-axis and also creates a scaled vector of x axis values from 0 to 1.  This function is useful for plotting and plot comparison.
