Description: Extracts sentiment and sentiment-derived plot arcs
    from text using three sentiment dictionaries conveniently
    packaged for consumption by R users.  Implemented dictionaries include
    "syuzhet" (default) developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab
    "afinn" developed by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen, "bing" developed by Minqing Hu
    and Bing Liu, and "nrc" developed by Mohammad, Saif M. and Turney, Peter D.
    Applicable references are available in README.md and in the documentation
    for the "get_sentiment" function.  The package also provides a hack for
    implementing Stanford's coreNLP sentiment parser. The package provides
    several methods for plot arc normalization.
